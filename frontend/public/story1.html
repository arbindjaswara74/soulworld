  <p>Once upon a time, there was a hare. He was fast, strong, and full of life... but alone.</p>
  <p>Humans had taken his family, his friends, his kind. He was the last of the hares in the forest.</p>
  <p>The only one who stayed with him was not another hare... but a tortoise. Not because the hare was friendly, but because he had no one else left. The tortoise was all he had.</p>
  <p>But loneliness makes the heart heavy. The hare fought with the tortoise often, teasing, mocking, running circles around him. Yet, behind the anger was something unspoken: he was afraid of losing even this last companion.</p>
  <p>The tortoise, too, was no stranger to pain. Among his own kind, he was bullied for being weak, for being slow, for being different. He carried silence in his shell, but deep inside he wished to be seen as a hero once.</p>
  <p>The hare knew something the tortoise did not. His life was short. The days ahead for him were fewer than the long years promised to the tortoise. He thought: “When I am gone, what will the tortoise remember of me? Only the fights? Only the mocking? Or will he remember that once, he mattered?”</p>
  <p>So the hare made a plan: his last gift.</p>
  <p>The next morning, he challenged the tortoise to a race. The forest animals gathered. Everyone expected the usual—the fast hare to win, the slow tortoise to lose.</p>
  <p>The race began. The hare sped ahead, dust rising under his feet. He glanced back, saw the tortoise far behind, and smiled sadly. He stopped under a tree, closed his eyes, and pretended to sleep. Not from arrogance, but from love.</p>
  <p>Step by step, the tortoise moved forward. His tiny feet carried him over stones, roots, and dirt. The forest laughed at his slowness, but he kept going. For the first time, he felt hope — maybe he could win.</p>
  <p>When the tortoise was near the finish line, the hare opened his eyes. He ran with all his strength, faster than he had ever run before. Not to win, but to show the tortoise that he had given his all. That the tortoise’s victory was real, not mercy.</p>
  <p>The tortoise crossed the line first. The forest erupted in cheers. For the first time, the bullied tortoise stood tall. He was a hero, not just to his kind, but to himself.</p>
  <p>The hare smiled, hidden in the crowd. No one saw his tears. That night, he left the forest. He walked into the traps of humans, knowing his time had come.</p>
  <p>And so the story was told for generations: the tortoise beat the hare. But what no one knew was that it was never a story of laziness. It was a story of love, of sacrifice, of a hare who gave away his victory so that his only friend could believe in himself.</p>
  <p>The tortoise lived long, but he never forgot. And in the silence of the nights, when the stars looked like running hares in the sky, he whispered softly, "You were always faster, my friend. But you gave me the race. And that is why you will always live in my soul."</p>
